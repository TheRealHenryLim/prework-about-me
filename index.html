      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>For the past two years I've been pursuing a career as a chef, doing stagiaires under Michelin trained chefs who come from legendary restaurants such as "Per se, The French Laundry, Cafe Boulud, and WD-40". Due to COVID-19, and feelings of burn out I am taking this time to diversify my skill set, spend time with family, rest, and get fit both physically, and mentally. I know two years dosen't seem like a long time, but it has been extremely tiring trying to keep up with the greatness of people who are at the top of their game, but I look forward to learning something new from the talented instructors of the UCF Bootcamp! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>"You know I'm from Atlanta, home of Georgia peaches..." -Trinidad James: Just A Lil' Thick 2016- </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I look at pottery, leatherwork, and gardening tutorials on Youtube, but I haven't actually attempted any of them yet...(But one day! I promise.)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Making ceramics for high-end restaurants, and having a bunch of apprentices.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Orlando, Florida. But not for long because it is just miserably hot here.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was asked to create a website for an internship I did, and fell in love with the creative aspect of it! re-visiting my favorite websites, and cherry picking diffrent aspects I really admired gave me a deep appreciation of the work web developers do (The reassured look I got from my luddite employer was also a contributing factor :D) </p>
